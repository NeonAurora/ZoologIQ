We are transforming an educational quiz application from a complex session-based learning system to a simpler pre-assessment unlock system.
Current System (Being Removed):

Complex study sessions with multiple states
Users could restart sessions multiple times
Session-based progress tracking
Current education status in user profiles

New System (Target):

One pre-test per topic (tiger, tapir, turtle) per user account
Pre-test completion unlocks lesson content and post-tests for that specific topic
Unlimited post-tests (always compared against original pre-test score)
Independent lesson access (users can read lessons anytime after pre-test)
Static references section at end of each lesson (English only, regardless of language toggle)
Removed current education status from user profiles (keep only highest education)

 IMPLEMENTATION PATH
Phase 1: Database & Services ✅ COMPLETED

Database schema modifications
Service function updates/creation
Remove session-based logic

Phase 2: UI Components 🔄 IN PROGRESS

Update quiz flow components
Modify drawer navigation with access control
Remove education status from profile components
Add references sections to lessons

Phase 3: Integration & Testing ⏳ PENDING

Test complete user flow
Ensure proper access controls
Verify data migration


📊 CURRENT PROGRESS STATUS
✅ COMPLETED:
Database Changes:

❌ Removed education_status column from users table
✅ Added pre_assessment_completed JSONB column to track: {"tiger": true, "tapir": false, "turtle": false}
✅ Updated quiz_results session_type constraints: 'pre-lesson', 'post-lesson', 'regular'

Service Functions - Complete Overhaul:
📁 userService.js - UPDATED:

✅ Added pre-assessment tracking functions:

updatePreAssessmentStatus(userId, topic, completed)
getPreAssessmentStatus(userId) → returns {tiger: false, tapir: true, turtle: false}
hasCompletedPreAssessment(userId, topic) → boolean
getCompletedTopics(userId) → array of completed topics

📁 quizResultService.js - UPDATED:

✅ Enhanced saveQuizResult() to auto-mark pre-assessment complete when session_type === 'pre-lesson'
✅ Added post-test functions:

getPreTestScore(userId, categoryId) → get original pre-test for comparison
savePostTestResult(resultData) → saves with improvement calculation
getAllPostTestAttempts(userId, categoryId) → all post-test history
getBestPostTestScore(userId, categoryId) → highest post-test score
getImprovementData(userId, categoryId) → comprehensive improvement analysis

📁 utilityService.js - UPDATED:

❌ Removed session functions: createStudySession, updateStudySession
✅ Added new utilities:

getUserOverallProgress(userId) → complete progress dashboard
getTopicAccessStatus(userId) → navigation access control
getTopicQuizSummary(userId, categoryId) → detailed topic analysis
checkFeatureAccess(userId, feature, topic) → centralized access control
getCategoryIdBySlug(topicSlug) → helper function

📁 learningSessionService.js - REMOVED:

❌ Entire file deleted (90% session-based logic no longer needed)

📁 index.js - UPDATED:

✅ Updated exports to include all new functions
❌ Removed all session-based exports
✅ Organized exports by functionality

⏳ PENDING (Next Steps):
UI Component Updates Needed:
🔧 Profile Components:

Remove education_status field from profile display
Remove education_status from edit profile form
Update form validation and submission logic

🔧 Quiz Flow Components:

Update quizPlay.jsx to use new pre/post test logic
Pre-test completion should navigate directly to lesson (no results shown)
Post-test results should compare against original pre-test score
Implement one-time pre-test restriction

 Navigation Components:

Update DrawerContent.jsx with lesson access control
Show/hide lesson links based on pre-assessment completion
Add lock icons for unavailable lessons
Display access requirements in alerts

🔧 Lesson Components:

Add references section to all lesson layouts (TigerLessonLayout, TapirLessonLayout, TurtleLessonLayout)
Create ReferencesSection.jsx component
Ensure references display in English only regardless of language toggle

 Learning Session Components:

Replace LearningSessionStarter.jsx with simpler pre-assessment checker
Remove session state management
Implement direct lesson/post-test access after pre-test completion

🎯 KEY BUSINESS RULES

One Pre-Test Rule: Each user can only take ONE pre-test per topic, ever
Unlock System: Pre-test completion unlocks both lessons and post-tests for that topic
Unlimited Post-Tests: Users can take post-tests as many times as they want
Comparison Logic: All post-test results compare against the original pre-test score
Independent Access: Lessons can be accessed anytime after pre-test (not tied to post-tests)
References Language: References section is always in English, language toggle has no effect
Access Control: Navigation must enforce pre-test requirements

📱 APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE
Current Database Schema:

users table:
- pre_assessment_completed JSONB  -- {"tiger": true, "tapir": false, "turtle": false}
- (education_status REMOVED)

quiz_results table:
- session_type: 'pre-lesson' | 'post-lesson' | 'regular'

Service Layer Structure:

userService.js       → User data + pre-assessment tracking
quizResultService.js → Quiz results + pre/post test logic  
utilityService.js    → Progress tracking + access control
categoryService.js   → Categories (unchanged)
quizService.js       → Quiz CRUD (unchanged) 
storage.js           → File uploads (unchanged)
audioService.js      → Audio URLs (unchanged)

Component Flow:
Home → Topic Selection → Pre-Test Check
                      ↓
                   Pre-Test Required → Take Pre-Test → Lesson Unlocked
                      ↓
                   Access Granted → Lesson + Unlimited Post-Tests
